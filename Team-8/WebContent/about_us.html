		<p>Shop It! Pvt Ltd. is an Indian electronic commerce company based in Bengaluru, 
		India. Founded by Uday Mukherjee and Sameer Dutta(senior-junior at Indian Institute
		 of Technology Delhi & colleagues at XYZ) in 2018, the company initially focused on 
		 book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer 
		 electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Shop It's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival 
Snapdeal,Amazon. As of 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.

its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck"
 with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.Shop It! also owns PhonePay,
